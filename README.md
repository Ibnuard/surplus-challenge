## Introduction
I did this challenge using a boilerplate that I made myself, I'm using React Native version 0.71.

## Run project
1. rm -rf node_modules && npm install
2. cd ios && pod install && cd ..
3. npx react-native run-ios or
4. npx react-native run-android

## Folder and files
 - api - Contain API and wrapper functions to call API.
 - components - Put common components here (e.g. Custom text component)
 - index.js - File called by App.js
 - context - handle react context
 - helper - mostly helper function
 - navigator - Handles react-navigation routing. Future routing can be separated into their own files.
 - screens - Files are sorted by their functionality (e.g. home folder contains index.js and other Screens that are unique to home)
 - styles - custom mocked style
 - utils - commonly used functions, constant variable, etc.
